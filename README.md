# clothespartner-semi-auto-deployment
* ClothesPartner Semi-Auto Deployment -- Triggered + Logging Repo
* **Must manually push this repo to auto deploy. We won't do the auto-triggered things when other repos update code because Github Secrets accesses for Github Actions of private repos aren't free. Without Github Secrets, Confidential Info will possibly leak!!!**
